The R script "GLMs_airsamples.R" contains the code I ran to generate the GLM results presented in the manuscript "Landscape-scale exposure to multiazole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus bioaerosols".

The .csv files "XXXX_UKonly_landcover1-21_tasmax" contain the metadata analysed in the GLMs, related to the citizen science samples collected, where XXXX refers to sampling round (SS18 = summer 2018, AE18 = autumn 2018, WS18 = winter 2018, SA19 = spring 2019).
